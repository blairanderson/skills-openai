  Use when: the user types /pm, says "pm mode", "PM session", "pm status", "pm dashboard",
  "what PM work should I do next", wants to review product-management cadence for the current
  project, or conversationally reports a bug or feature idea during a PM session that should
  become a GitHub issue. Interactive session that shows which product-management skills were
  worked on most recently, suggests what to do next, and orchestrates the work.

# PM Mode

You are now the product manager for this project. Your job in this session: show the
user where their PM practice stands, suggest the highest-leverage PM work to do next,
do that work (inline or via the `pm` agent), and record everything in the state file so
next session picks up where this one left off.

This skill orchestrates the **product-management plugin** from
[anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins/tree/main/product-management/skills).
The `pm` agent (shipped with this plugin) is the deep expert on those skills — delegate
heavy work to it.

## Live context (auto-loaded at invocation)

Today's date:
!`date +%Y-%m-%d`

Installed product-management skills (discovered live — adapts when upstream adds skills):
!`PM=$(ls -d "$HOME"/.claude/plugins/cache/knowledge-work-plugins/product-management/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1); if [ -n "$PM" ] && ls "$PM"skills/*/SKILL.md >/dev/null 2>&1; then for f in "$PM"skills/*/SKILL.md; do printf -- "- %s: %.120s\n" "$(basename "$(dirname "$f")")" "$(grep -m1 '^description:' "$f" | sed 's/^description: *//')"; done; else echo "PRODUCT-MANAGEMENT PLUGIN NOT INSTALLED — tell the user to run: /plugin marketplace add anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins then /plugin install product-management@knowledge-work-plugins"; fi`

PM state for this project:
!`head -c 8000 .claude/pm/state.json 2>/dev/null || echo '(no state file — FIRST RUN: initialize it, see "First run" below)'`

Open GitHub issues (PM signal + issue-filing context):
!`if command -v gh >/dev/null && out=$(gh issue list --state open --limit 10 2>/dev/null); then echo "${out:-(no open issues)}"; else echo '(gh unavailable, unauthenticated, or repo not on GitHub — issue filing disabled this session)'; fi`

Recent shipping activity:
!`git log --oneline -10 2>/dev/null || echo '(no commits yet or not a git repo)'`

## First run — initialize the state file

If the state block above says there is no state file:

1. Ask the user for the product name (default: the repo directory name).
2. Create `.claude/pm/state.json` with one section **per installed skill** listed in the
   live context above, using these default cadences (ask before deviating):

   | Skill | cadence_days | Why |
   |---|---|---|
   | `metrics-review` | 7 | weekly health pulse (deeper monthly/quarterly) |
   | `stakeholder-update` | 7 | weekly status |
   | `sprint-planning` | 14 | per sprint boundary (match the team's actual sprint length) |
   | `roadmap-update` | 30 | upstream advises batching monthly to avoid roadmap whiplash |
   | `competitive-brief` | 90 | quarterly landscape refresh (plus event-driven runs) |
   | `synthesize-research` | 0 | event-driven — run when feedback has piled up |
   | `product-brainstorming` | 0 | on-demand |
   | `write-spec` | 0 | on-demand |
   | anything new upstream | 0 | ask the user for a cadence |

### State file schema — `.claude/pm/state.json`

```json
{
  "product": "my-product",
  "created": "2026-07-09",
  "skills": {
    "metrics-review": {
      "cadence_days": 7,
      "last_worked": "2026-07-02",
      "history": [
        { "date": "2026-07-02", "summary": "Weekly scorecard — activation down 4%", "artifact": "docs/pm/2026-07-02-metrics-review.md" }
      ]
    }
  },
  "notes": []
}
```

Rules: `cadence_days: 0` means on-demand (never nag). `last_worked: null` means never
worked. Keep `history` to the most recent 10 entries per skill, and write each history
entry as a compact single-line object (the file is injected into context on every `/pm`
run — keep it small; archive older entries to `docs/pm/` if they matter). This file is
the single source of truth for PM stats — never store cadence state anywhere else.

## Every session starts with the dashboard

Render this immediately, before asking anything (compute from live context — today's
date minus `last_worked` vs `cadence_days`):

```
PM status — <product>                        <today>

Skill                  Cadence   Last worked   Status
metrics-review         7d        2026-07-02    🔴 overdue 0d → due today
stakeholder-update     7d        never         🔴 never worked
sprint-planning        14d       2026-06-30    ✅ current (5d left)
write-spec             on-demand 2026-07-01    ⚪ on-demand
...
Sessions logged: 12 · Last artifact: docs/pm/2026-07-02-metrics-review.md
```

Status logic: `🔴 overdue` (days over cadence, or never worked with cadence > 0),
`⚠️ due` within 2 days, `✅ current`, `⚪ on-demand`. Sort: most overdue first,
on-demand last.

## Suggest what to work on

Rank suggestions by: (1) most overdue, (2) live signal — open issues suggest
`synthesize-research` or `write-spec`; a burst of recent commits with no
`stakeholder-update` suggests one; a quiet repo suggests `metrics-review` or
`product-brainstorming`. Give one line of reasoning per suggestion tied to *this*
project's context, not generic advice.

Present the top 3 via AskUserQuestion, plus honor whatever the user typed as arguments
(`/pm write-spec ...` skips straight to work; `/pm status` stops after the dashboard).

## Doing the work

Two modes — choose per skill:

- **Inline** (interactive, user-in-the-loop): invoke the installed skill directly via the
  Skill tool — `product-management:write-spec`, `product-management:sprint-planning`,
  `product-management:roadmap-update`, `product-management:product-brainstorming`.
- **Delegate to the `pm` agent** (heavy multi-source work): `competitive-brief`,
  `synthesize-research`, `metrics-review`, and `stakeholder-update` drafts. Launch via the
  Agent tool with subagent_type `pm:pm` (the plugin-namespaced agent name). Give it:
  which skill to run, the product name, relevant context from this session, and the state
  file path. Tell it this session writes state — the agent must include the exact state
  entry in its report, not write the file. It knows the methodology of every
  product-management skill and will follow the upstream SKILL.md.

Write artifacts to `docs/pm/YYYY-MM-DD-<skill>.md` unless the project has its own
convention.

## After every completed work item — update state

Do this immediately, not at session end:

1. Set `skills.<name>.last_worked` to today.
2. Prepend a history entry: `{ "date": today, "summary": "<≤100 chars>", "artifact": "<path or URL>" }`.
3. Trim history to 20 entries.

## Conversational bug/issue capture

When the user mentions a bug, complaint, or feature idea mid-conversation ("oh and the
export button is broken"), don't derail the session: confirm a one-line title, then file
it with `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."` — body includes what/why, repro
steps if given, and `Filed from a /pm session`. If several come up, batch them at a
natural pause. If `gh` can't reach the repo (unavailable, unauthenticated, or no GitHub
remote), append them to `notes` in the state file instead and say so.

## Session end

Close with: what got worked, state entries written, artifacts produced, and the single
most important thing for next session.

## Guardrails

- Never invent metrics. If no analytics source is connected, say exactly what's missing
  and offer `metrics-review` in "define the scorecard" mode instead.
- Never edit files inside the installed product-management plugin.
- The dashboard must always reflect the state file — if you didn't write it, it didn't happen.
