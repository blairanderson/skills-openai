# /organizer — File Organization Skill

Organize files across `~/Desktop`, `~/Downloads`, and `~/Documents` into a structured, business-aware folder hierarchy. All moves are logged for undo capability.

## Modes

| Mode | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Quick** (default) | Scan Desktop/Downloads for files modified in the last 30 days. Route to Documents subfolders. Fast periodic cleanup. |
| **Deep** | Full scan of all 3 directories. Includes duplicate detection (md5 hashing), age audit (flag files untouched 6+ months), and screenshot sorting. |

## Step 1: Ask Mode

If the user didn't specify a mode in the command arguments, ask:

> Quick mode (sort recent files) or Deep mode (full scan + duplicates + age audit)?

Default to Quick if no answer.

## Step 2: Scan

### Quick Mode
```bash
# Files modified in last 30 days on Desktop and Downloads
find ~/Desktop -maxdepth 1 -not -name '.DS_Store' -not -name '.localized' -newer $(date -v-30d +%Y%m%d) 2>/dev/null
find ~/Downloads -maxdepth 1 -not -name '.DS_Store' -not -name '.localized' -newer $(date -v-30d +%Y%m%d) 2>/dev/null
```

Use `ls -lt` and filter by date if `find -newer` is awkward. The goal is recent files only.

### Deep Mode
```bash
# Everything at top level of all 3 dirs
ls -la ~/Desktop/
ls -la ~/Downloads/
ls -la ~/Documents/
```

Also run duplicate detection:
```bash
# Find files with identical content across all 3 dirs
find ~/Desktop ~/Downloads ~/Documents -maxdepth 2 -type f -exec md5 -q {} + 2>/dev/null | sort | uniq -d
```

And age audit:
```bash
# Files not modified in 6+ months
find ~/Desktop ~/Downloads ~/Documents -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +180
```

## Step 3: Classify Files

Use these routing rules to classify each file. Rules are checked in order — first match wins.

### Directory Detection (check FIRST for directories)

**Dev project directories** — any directory containing code project markers:
- `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `.git/`

Route to: `~/Documents/DEV-INBOX/` — NEVER auto-sort dev projects. The user reviews these manually and decides whether to move to `~/dev/` or delete.

### File Routing Rules

**Tax documents** — filename contains: `1040`, `W2`, `w-2`, `7004`, `extension`, `K-1`, `tax`, `Tax`, `TAX`, `1099`, `form-`, `TaxJar`
- Route to: `~/Documents/TAXES/{year}/` — extract year from filename or fall back to file modification year

**Amazon seller documents** — filename contains: `amazon`, `Amazon`, `AMZN`, `amzn`, `FBA`, `fba`, `buy-box`, `BuyBox`, `seller`, `Seller`, `Direct-Fulfillment`, `DirectFulfillment`, `DF-`, `shipment`, `B0` (ASIN prefix)
- Route to: `~/Documents/AMAZON-SELLER/`

**Vendor-specific (Amazon sub-categories):**
- Filename contains `cordova`, `Cordova`, `CORDOVA` → `~/Documents/AMAZON-SELLER/cordova/`
- Filename contains `truper`, `Truper`, `TRUPER` → `~/Documents/AMAZON-SELLER/truper/`
- Filename contains `beacon`, `Beacon`, `BEACON` → `~/Documents/AMAZON-SELLER/beacon/`
- Filename contains `myriad`, `Myriad`, `MYRIAD` → `~/Documents/AMAZON-SELLER/myriad/`
- Filename contains `grassmaster`, `Grassmaster`, `GRASSMASTER` → `~/Documents/AMAZON-SELLER/grassmaster/`
- Filename contains `lasco`, `Lasco`, `LASCO` → `~/Documents/AMAZON-SELLER/reports/`
- Filename contains `mosaic`, `Mosaic` → `~/Documents/AMAZON-SELLER/reports/`

**Amazon reports/data** — file extension is `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.xls` AND filename suggests Amazon data (contains `catalog`, `pricing`, `SKU`, `sku`, `forecast`, `inventory`, `payment`, `settlement`, `search-term`, `advertising`)
- Route to: `~/Documents/AMAZON-SELLER/reports/`

**FBA guides & manuals** — filename contains: `pallet`, `labeling`, `vendor-manual`, `shipment-guide`, `fulfillment-guide`, `EDI`, `edi`
- Route to: `~/Documents/AMAZON-SELLER/fba-guides/`

**Anderson-Savant** — filename contains: `Anderson-Savant`, `anderson-savant`, `SOW`, `sow`, `consulting-agreement`
- Route to: `~/Documents/ANDERSON-SAVANT/`

**Invoices & receipts** — filename contains: `invoice`, `Invoice`, `INVOICE`, `receipt`, `Receipt`, `RECEIPT`, `credit-memo`, `CREDIT MEMO`, `payment-confirmation`
- Route to: `~/Documents/BOOK-KEEPING/invoices/`

**Insurance** — filename contains: `insurance`, `Insurance`, `COI`, `certificate-of-insurance`
- Route to: `~/Documents/BOOK-KEEPING/insurance/`

**Legal** — filename contains: `arbitration`, `ARBITRATION`, `reseller-agreement`, `compliance`, `legal`
- Route to: `~/Documents/LEGAL/`

**Personal** — filename contains: `resume`, `passport`, `vasectomy`, `medical`, `consent`, `unclaimed-property`
- Route to: `~/Documents/PERSONAL/`

**Logos & brand assets** — filename contains: `logo`, `Logo`, `LOGO`, or file is in a directory named `LOGOS`
- Route to: `~/Documents/LOGOS/`

**HR** — filename contains: `HR-`, `hr-`, `human-resources`, `HR-violations`
- Route to: `~/Documents/HR/`

**Installers** — file extension is `.dmg`, `.pkg`, `.app`
- Route to: `~/Documents/INSTALLERS/`

**Screenshots** — filename starts with `Screenshot`, `CleanShot`, or matches pattern `YYYY-MM-DD at HH.MM.SS`:
- If filename contains a keyword matching another category above, route there
- Otherwise route to: `~/Documents/PERSONAL/screenshots/`

**Archive candidates** (Deep mode only) — directories that appear inactive (no files modified in 6+ months):
- Route to: `~/Documents/ARCHIVE/`

**Unclassified** — anything that doesn't match above rules:
- Do NOT auto-move. List these separately and ask the user what to do with them.

## Step 4: Present Plan

Group proposed moves by destination category. Show a table like:

```
## Proposed Moves

### TAXES/2024/ (12 files)
- ~/Desktop/2024-Form-1040.pdf
- ~/Downloads/W2-KAnderson-2024.pdf
...

### AMAZON-SELLER/cordova/ (8 files)
- ~/Downloads/cordova/  (entire directory)
...

### DEV-INBOX/ (3 directories)
- ~/Downloads/project/  (has package.json)
- ~/Downloads/grassmaster-site/  (has index.html + JS)
...

### UNCLASSIFIED (5 files)
- ~/Desktop/random-thing.pdf
- ~/Downloads/mystery-file.xlsx
...
```

Ask user to confirm. They can:
- Approve all
- Approve by section
- Skip specific files
- Specify where unclassified files should go

## Step 5: Execute Moves

Create destination directories first:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/AMAZON-SELLER/{cordova,truper,beacon,myriad,grassmaster,reports,fba-guides,advertising}
mkdir -p ~/Documents/TAXES/{2021,2022,2023,2024,2025}
mkdir -p ~/Documents/BOOK-KEEPING/{invoices,insurance}
mkdir -p ~/Documents/{ANDERSON-SAVANT,LEGAL,PERSONAL,PERSONAL/screenshots,LOGOS,HR,ARCHIVE,DEV-INBOX,INSTALLERS}
```

Move files using `mv -n` (no-clobber — never overwrite existing files).

**Log every move** to `~/Documents/.organize-log`:
```bash
echo "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)|/original/path/file.pdf|/new/path/file.pdf" >> ~/Documents/.organize-log
```

Format: `ISO-TIMESTAMP|SOURCE_PATH|DEST_PATH`

If `mv -n` skips a file (destination exists), log it as a conflict and report to user.

## Step 6: Summary

After moving, show:

```
## Organization Complete

- Moved: X files, Y directories
- Skipped (conflicts): Z files
- Unclassified (needs manual sort): W files
- Dev projects in inbox: N directories (review at ~/Documents/DEV-INBOX/)

### Breakdown
| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| TAXES | 12 |
| AMAZON-SELLER | 45 |
| BOOK-KEEPING | 8 |
| ... | ... |

### Move log
All moves recorded in ~/Documents/.organize-log
To undo the last run: review the log and reverse the moves

### Next run
Suggest running /organizer quick in 1-2 weeks to catch new files.
```

## Step 7: Deep Mode Extras

Only in Deep mode, also:

### Duplicate Report
```
## Duplicate Files Found

### Same content (md5 match)
1. ~/Desktop/invoice-123.pdf ↔ ~/Downloads/invoice-123.pdf (2.3 MB each)
   Recommendation: Keep ~/Documents/BOOK-KEEPING/invoices/invoice-123.pdf, delete the other

### Same filename, different content
1. ~/Desktop/report.csv (45 KB, modified 2024-06) ↔ ~/Downloads/report.csv (52 KB, modified 2024-09)
   Recommendation: Keep newer version
```

Ask user to confirm each deletion.

### Age Audit
```
## Stale Files (not modified in 6+ months)

### Archive candidates
- ~/Desktop/old-project/ (last modified: 2023-11-15)
- ~/Downloads/ancient-report.pdf (last modified: 2023-08-20)

Move these to ~/Documents/ARCHIVE/?
```

## Important Rules

1. **NEVER delete files without explicit user confirmation** — always move, never delete by default
2. **NEVER auto-sort dev projects** — always route to DEV-INBOX for manual review
3. **ALWAYS use `mv -n`** — never overwrite existing files
4. **ALWAYS log moves** — every move gets a line in `.organize-log`
5. **ALWAYS present the plan before executing** — no surprise moves
6. **Skip `.DS_Store` and `.localized`** — macOS recreates these, ignore them
7. **Preserve directory structure** — when moving a directory, move it whole (don't flatten)
8. **Handle spaces in filenames** — always quote paths in shell commands
